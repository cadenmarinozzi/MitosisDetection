# TODO list

- Add single sample image splitting to allow for a single sample image to be inputted, and split into multiple images of each cell in the image for processing.
- Instead of generating training data for the CNN, train a diffusion model to generate the training data for the CNN from real cell images.
- Allow for analysis of the mitotic index by inputting parameters for the individual the cells were taken from, such as their age, weight, height, where the cells were taken from, etc, in order to determine if the mitotic index is normal for that individual, and if not, what the cause of the abnormality is, such as cancer, or a genetic mutation.
